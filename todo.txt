### wish list
- make api auto deploy via terraform
- error page
- invalidating cloudfront cache
### necessary
- edge lambda -- route users to site a b or c depending on their access level
- get spinner working
- get static site pipeline working
- investigate storing as a csv


what do you name terraform resources?
why do we need a new certificate in eu-west-2 to make this work? 
how does the cloudfront cache get invalidated when dynamic content is uploaded?
am i caching options/preflight request properly
