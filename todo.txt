### wish list
- make api auto deploy via terraform
- error page
- invalidating cloudfront cache
- figure out why site wasn't working in Korea
### necessary
- be able to find a guest by their id (for the edge lambda to populate with rsvp data)
- see if you can make the login image bigger on mobile
- make thank you bigger (fuck around with cropping container for images)
-make the big day take up full viewport on mobile
- navigating on page


what do you name terraform resources?
why do we need a new certificate in eu-west-2 to make this work? 
how does the cloudfront cache get invalidated when dynamic content is uploaded?
am i caching options/preflight request properly
