### wish list
- make api auto deploy via terraform
- put api behind route53
- error page
- invalidating cloudfront cache
- customize cloudfront cache key to use headers
### necessary
- handle login redirect
- edge lambda -- route users to site a b or c depending on their access level
- get spinner working
- get static site pipeline working
- investigate storing as a csv


what do you name terraform resources?
why do we need a new certificate in eu-west-2 to make this work? 
put new cert into terraform, use it to validate the api gateway
how does it work validating an ACM certificate? and how does CNAME fit into that?
